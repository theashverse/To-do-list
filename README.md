# 📝 Simple To-Do List

A small and simple To-Do List project I built over a month ago using **Vite**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This was just a personal practice project to improve my frontend skills and experiment with basic task management logic.  
Not meant for production — just something I made to learn and have fun!

##  Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as **done**
- Delete tasks
- **Uppercase** all tasks with a button click
- Clean, minimal UI
- Built using Vite for a fast and simple dev setup

> Note: This is a basic project and not fully responsive or polished for public use.

##  Tech Stack
